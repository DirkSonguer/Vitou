# Vitou

Vitou is a proof of concept for a game server middleware. Proof of concept means you should not use this in a productive environment, it's just there to toy around with some ideas and concepts on how to handle data and workflows.

The name does not mean anything, it was randomly created by a phonetic password generator. I was fed up calling the thing just "gameserver" all the time.

## Documentation overview

* /server/basics should give you a good overview on how the server works and where everything is
* /server/howto shows you how to implement your own game
* /server/configuration contains details on how to configure the server
* /API/ contains all individual Vitou core API calls
