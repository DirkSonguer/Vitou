# Vitou

Vitou is a proof of concept for a game server middleware. Proof of concept means you should not use this in a productive environment, it's just there to toy around with some ideas and concepts on how to handle data and workflows.

The name does not mean anything, it was randomly created by a phonetic password generator. I was fed up calling the thing just "gameserver" all the time.

## Basic assumptions

Vitou was developed based on a couple of design assumptions:

* A developer should not need to change the core server code, but only write code related to his specific game
* Game specific code should be so simple that it can be easily auto generated by other GUI-based UIs
* Data structures should be super simple to define
* Game based data should be super simple to import

## Documentation overview

* /server/basics should give you a good overview on how the server works and where everything is
* /server/howto shows you how to implement your own game
* /server/configuration contains details on how to configure the server

* /API/ contains all individual Vitou core API calls

* /examplegame/game_description contains a desciption for an example game that Vitou implements
* /examplegame/game_scenario shows an example scenario of two clients playing the example game
* /examplegame/API/ contains all individual calls for the example game
