# Game Server Proof of Concept

This is a proof of concept for a game server middleware.

Please note: This is a proof of concept.

That means: It is a really, really bad idea to use this thing in any way productive. For example it only runs in memory. There is no data storage attached and if it crashes, all is gone. Also, there is no real security and it's full of things that will affect performance in a very, very bad way. In other words I tried to add TODOs as a blacklist but gave up since there would be too many. Got it?


# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Get node.js: https://nodejs.org/download/
- Change in the project root and get all dependencies with "npm install"

## Run servers
- "node ./gameserver.js" in project root runs the game server 

- "node ./testserver.js" in project root runs a server that provides a demo interface
- You can open it via browser at "http://localhost:8887/"
- It will send a test client that allows you to send events to the server


# How to use as client

The calls to the server revolves around modules, actions and data, handed over in a
JSON object.

{
	"module": "STRING",
	"action": "STRING",
	"data": "STRING"
};

The module defines the directory within /server_module, the action defines the file
to call. Data describes what is handed over to the function.

Example: { "module": "lobby", "action": "joinlobby", "data": "a86c3760-3a05-11e5-a155-fd6757717cdb" };


# Proof of Concept Game

The proof of concept tries to implement the following game as example.

## Main Game - Tank fight
- 2 player vs. game
- Each player is represented one of his his personl tanks he choses in the lobby
- Tanks have randomised starting positions on a 2D map
- Starting player is chosen at random
- Each round a player can either move up to his total speed along a vector or shoot
- Players take turns
- When a weapon hits a tank, it reduces the hitpoints of the hit tank
- If a tank has <= 0 hitpoints, it is destroyed
- A player wins if he destorys the other players tank
- The winner gets 10 money

## Meta - Player tanks
- Each player can own multiple tanks
- Each tank has hitpoints (=life)
- Each tank has a size (=hitbox)
- Each tank has a position on the map
- Each tank has a speed he can move with
- Each tank can be equiped with a weapon turret
- There are multiple types of tanks, each with different values for hitpoints, size and speed
- Each tank type has a price
- Each player starts with one tank of default type on account creation
- Players can buy more tanks for money

## Meta - Tank weapon turrets
- Each weapon turret causes damage on hit
- Each weapon turret can be fired in each direction (0째-360째) around the tanks position
- Each weapon turret can be angled at a max angle (0째-max째) in height
- Each weapon can be fired with a specific power (0-max power), making the projectile go further
- Players can buy tank weapon turrets
- Every type of weapon turret can be mounted to every type of tank


# How to get this game

We expect two clients (Player1, Player2) that connect and play together. This is the "script"
they go through from a server view.

1) Player 1: Connect to the server as socket
2) Player 2: Connect to the server as socket
3) Player 1: Call lobby/create
4) Player 2: Call lobby/join with lobbyId from (3)
5) Player 1: Call lobby/confirm
6) Player 2: Call lobby/confirm

) Player 1: Disconnect from the server
) Player 2: Disconnect from the server
